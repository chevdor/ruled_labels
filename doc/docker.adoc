== Docker

If you prefer not having to install Rust & Cargo and have Docker installed, you may prefer to run a dockerized version of {cli}. The next chapters explain how to proceed.

=== Run

Docker commands can end up quite lenghty so you may like to set an alias:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    alias {prj}='docker run --rm -it {prj}'
----

After setting this alias, you may use {cli} by simply invoking the {cli} command:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    {prj} --version
----

NOTE: If you prefer a shorter a command, you may set an alias for `rl` instead of {cli}.

This is out of the scope of this documentation but note that you cannot just invoke {cli} check and expect it to work on your local `specs.yaml`. For that to work, you need to mount your `specs.yaml` into the container. That looks like this:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    docker run --rm -it -v $PWD/specs.yaml:/usr/local/bin/specs.yaml {cli} list
----

=== Build

You can pull the docker image from `chevdor`/{cli} or build you own:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    docker build -t {prj} .
----
