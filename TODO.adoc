== TODOS

// tag::todo[]
[.column]
- testing! testing! testing!
- more documentation
- code cleanup
- Release ci including deb packaging

[.column]
- add `--no-color`
- improve `check` hints
- Support for `Option<Tag>` for `check`
- Support for weight/priority
// end::todo[]

- [x] get check to work
- [x] deal with all todos
- [x] get test to pass
- [x] add tera template
- [x] add an option to have a decription in the rules, for the doc
- [x] Sets real Sets and not Vec, in order to avoid dups


== Live testing

It would be nice having ways to do live testing:

- in a console, maybe using fzf and its preview feature
- in vscode, to live reload and work on the rules


== Extremely useful would be:

Impl some From<&str> from a comma separated would help avoiding those vec![Bla::try_from("One").unwrap(), Bla::try_from("Two").unwrap()] and use instead Foo::from("One,Two") and panic if needed.

- LabelId::from("B1") -> LabelId
- vec<LabelId>::from("B1,B2") -> Vec<LabelId>
- LabelSet::from("B1,B2")-> LabelSet
